# Images

The general idea here is to eventually add support for multiple texture packs. For now, a single PNG represents a texture pack.

The `programmer.png` file is a texture pack I'll be using for development, because I can't be arsed to do the graphics properly right now. It's not gonna be pretty, but it'll be enough for me to work in the other more fun bits of the game.

Pixel art is not my strength, to put it mildly :ablobsweats:
